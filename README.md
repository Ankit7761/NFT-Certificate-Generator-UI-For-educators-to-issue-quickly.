Hereâ€™s a clean and complete **README** for your Move smart contract:

# ðŸ“œ Certificate Generator on Aptos

## 1. Title of the Project

**Certificate Generator â€“ NFT-Based Academic Credentialing System on Aptos**

---

## 2. Description of the Project

This smart contract enables educators to issue blockchain-based certificates to students on the Aptos network.
It works in two steps:

* **Educator Registration:** Educators register themselves with their name, creating an on-chain registry of verified issuers.
* **Certificate Issuance:** Educators can issue unique, NFT-like certificates to students. Each certificate contains the studentâ€™s name, course name, issue date, and the educatorâ€™s address, making it a tamper-proof digital credential stored in the studentâ€™s account.

The contract also tracks the total number of certificates issued by each educator.

## 3. Vision of the Project

To create a **transparent, secure, and decentralized system for issuing academic or professional certificates**. By using Aptos and the Move language, the system ensures that credentials are:

* **Authentic & Verifiable** (directly from the educatorâ€™s on-chain account)
* **Immutable & Non-replicable** (unique NFT-like resources)
* **Easily Transferable & Accessible** (stored directly in studentsâ€™ accounts for easy proof)

This helps eliminate fake certificates and builds trust between institutions, students, and employers.

## 4. Future Scope of the Project

* **Metadata & IPFS Integration:** Add links to off-chain certificate files (PDF, images) stored on IPFS or Aptosâ€™ storage solutions.
* **Revocation / Update Mechanism:** Allow educators to revoke or reissue certificates if needed.
* **Verification Portal / DApp:** Build a front-end web or mobile interface for third parties (employers, universities) to instantly verify a studentâ€™s certificate.
* **Multi-educator Accreditation:** Support consortiums of educators or organizations issuing co-signed certificates.
* **Badge & Achievement System:** Extend functionality to issue micro-credentials, badges, or skill endorsements.
* **Automation & Analytics:** Generate reports on course completions, issue trends, and educator performance.

Would you like me to **add a sample usage guide** (like a short code snippet on how to call `register_educator` and `issue_certificate`) in the README as well? (It makes it look very professional.)
